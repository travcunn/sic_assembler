SIC/XE Assembler
================

The SIC machine is a hypothetical computer system that can be found in "System Software: An Introduction to Systems Programming", by Leland Beck.

This is a 2 pass SIC/XE assembler.


Installation
------------

Via source code / GitHub:

    $ git clone https://github.com/travcunn/sic_assembler.git sic_assembler
    $ cd sic_assembler
    $ python setup.py install
    

Usage
-----
```python
>>> from sic_assembler import Assembler
>>>
>>> a = Assembler(open('source-file.asm', 'r'))
>>> # Generate some assembly
>>> a.assemble()
>>>
>>> # Array of the objects generated with some debugging information
>>> a.generated_objects
[]
```

**You can also run each pass separately:**
```python
>>> from sic_assembler import Assembler
>>>
>>> a = Assembler(open('source-file.asm', 'r'))
>>> # Run through the first pass
>>> a.first_pass()
>>>
>>> # Array of the intermediate contents produced by the first pass
>>> a.temp_contents
[]
>>> # Run through the second pass
>>> a.second_pass()
>>>
>>> # Array of the objects generated by the second pass
>>> a.generated_objects
[]
```


Command Line
------------
Included is a command line utility for assembling source files, which can be run after installing the package:

    $ sic-assembler ./my-program.asm
    
Or specify an output file:

    $ sic-assembler ./my-program.asm -o outfile
    
You can also pipe things around:

    $ cat my-program.asm | sic-assembler > outfile


Testing
-------
Run all of the tests:

    $ python tests.py
